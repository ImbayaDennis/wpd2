#Coursework Scheduling Web Application

Coping with many coursework deliverables is a stressful part of every studentâ€™s life. The purpose of this project is is to design a web-based coursework scheduling application to help students cope with multiple coursework assignments.  At its core, the coursework scheduling application contains a list of coursework projects that have to be submitted. The application allows the user to define his or her own milestones for each of the coursework projects. These are only visible to this user, i.e. require a login. In order to be useful the coursework projects and their milestones exist for longer than one session.

Some of the functionality that will need to be implemented include:

*Coursework projects can be added.

*Coursework projects can be removed.

*Coursework projects can be modified.

*A listing of all incomplete courseworks and their milestones.

*Users should be able to share a project with other users by sending a link. At a base level you can assume that anyone who has the link has permission to see that project.
